### FPS: Frame Per Second

\# about

- Time.deltaTime: Unity can tell us how long each frame took to execute. 1 fps how much time spent?
- Multiply something on Time.deltaTime makes our game "frame rate independent". > for not affected by cpu ability, but time
  - This means the game behaves same on fast and slow computers.


|  fps  | Duration of frame |
| :---: | :---------------: |
|  10   |      0.1  s       |
|  100  |      0.01 s       |
