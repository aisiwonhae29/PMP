# electron

### about

- This is an open-source framework that enables developers to build cross-platform desktop application using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JS. Created maintained by GitHub, Electron combines the
  Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime, allowing developers to leverage web technologies to created powerful desktop applications

### key Features of electron

1. Cross-Platform Compatibility: enables to develovers run the app on win, macOS, and linux
2. Chromium Rendering Engine: Electron utilizes the same rendering engine as Google Chrome, providing a reliable and consistent environment to render web content
3. Node.js integration: Electron seamlessly integrates Node.js, allowing access to native OS functionalities and filesystem operations from within the application
4. Native APIs: It provides APIs to interact with the underlying operating system.
5. Community and Ecosystem: has many community info, rich plugins, tools, and resources
6. Easy Deployment: packaged as standalone executables for distribution

### How Electron Works

1. Main and Renderer Processes

- Electron is consisted of two parts: main process and renderer processes.

- main process controls the application lifecycle, interacts with the operating system, and manages renderer processes

- Renderer processes are responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions

2. HTML, CSS, and JS

- use this for user interface and implement the application's functionality

- Electron applications are essentially web applications packaged to run as desktop applications
