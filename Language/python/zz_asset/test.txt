Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. -Confucius
Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. -George Santayana
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. -Sun Tzu
“If you know the enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. 
If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. 
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle”
“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity”
“Who wishes to fight must first count the cost”
“There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations 
of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.”
