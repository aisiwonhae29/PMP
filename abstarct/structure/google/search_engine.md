### about

### Tech

\# Navboost

- collects data on how users interact with - search results specifically through their clicks on different queries.
- This system tabulates clicks and uses algorithms that learn from human-made quality ratings to improve the ranking of results.
- Differntiates between phone, PC and considers location.
- Records a click data from querioes.

**conclusion** Find good search algorithm.

\# RankBrain

- This is a Google AI and machine learning system, essential in processing search results.
- This uses Tensor Processing Unit to enhance its processing capability and enrgy efficiency.
- This continually improves its ability to understand language and the intentions behind searches and particularly effective in interpreting ambiguous or complex queries.
- QBST and Term Weighting are components of RanBrain.
  - QBST(Query Based Salient Terms)
    - QBST focuses on the most important terms within a query and related documents, using this information to influence how results are ranked.
  - Term Weighting
    - Adjusts the relative importance of individual terms within a query, based on how users interact with search results.\
    - This helps determine how relevant certain terms are in teh context of the query.

**conclusion** Make proram more accurately on search result.

\# DeepRank
  
- DeepRank is the internal name for BERT
- By pre-training on large amount of document and adjusting with human feedback, DeepRank can fine-tune search results to be more intuitive and relevant to qualified result.

**conclusion** Understand more on query

\# RankEmbed

- RankEmbed focuses on the task of embedding relevant features for ranking.

### summary

- Navboost: collect data with search result.
- RankBrain: AI machine learning system, it train with user's search result.
  - QBST: focuses on the most important terms within a query and related documents, make a good result for ambiguous and complex query
  - Term Weighting: Make a decision for the relative importance each terms within a query, based on search engine's db term's are rare or often occurs and making balance.
