 user interface and communication layer of the application
 interact with the application

 logic tier & middle tier => heart of the application
 using business logic
 
- Data tier

 called database tier || back-end

2. Benefits of Three-tier architecture

- Improved reliability: when an outage has less impact on others

- Improved security: presentation tier and data tier can't communicate
