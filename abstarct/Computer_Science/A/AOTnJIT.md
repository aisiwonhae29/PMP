# AOT & JIT compilation

### AOT

- involves converting the source code or an intermediate representation of code into machine code before the program is run.

- This means that the code is compiled into executable form during the build process or before the program's execution.

- C, C++, and some statically-typed languages exists

### JIT

- compiles code into machine code during runtime, just before it is executed.

- often used in dynamically-typed languages like JavaScript, Java, and Python.

- They take the advantage of runtime information to optimize the code for the specific environment it's running in

- This dynamic compilation allows the system to adapt to runtime donditions and optimize for performance characteristics of the underying hardware.
