# Abstraction layer

### about

- An abstraction layer in programming refers to a seperating the implementation details from the interface or functionality that users interact with.
- Its a concept used to manage complexity and improve maintainability and scalability of software systems.


### features

1. Hiding complexity
   
- Abstraction layers hide the underlying complexity by providing a simplified interface

2. Modularity & Encapsulation
   
- Each layers focuses on a specific aspect of functionality.

3. Interoperability

- Abstraction layers facilitate interoperability by providing a standardized interface that can be accessed by different components or modules within a system.

4. Adaptability

- Abstraction make it easier to adapt or replace underlying components without affecting the overall functionality of the system.

### examples

- OSI model
- network protocols
- OpenGL
- graphics libraries
