# Abstraction layer

### about

- An abstraction layer in programming refers to a conceptual division or interface between different layers of software or hardware components.
- It allows developers to interact with complex systems by hiding the implementation details and providing a simplified interface.


### features

- Abstraction: At its core, abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only relevant information. This allows users or developers to interact with a system without needing to
                understand its internal complexities.
- Layering: Abstraction layers are often structured in a hierarchical manner.


### examples

- OSI model
- network protocols
- OpenGL
- graphics libraries

\# shared features.
- Allow the separation of concerns to facilitate interoperatability and platform independence.
