# jenkins

### about 

- Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration(CI) and continuous delivery(CD) in software development. It allows developers to automate various stages of the software development lifecycle
  including building, testing, and deploying applications

### Key Features of Jenkins

1. Continuous Integration(CI): automates the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. automatically trigers builds and tests whenever new code is committed, ensuring early detection of integration issues
   
2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment(CD): facilitates the automation of deploying applications to various environment (e.g., staging, production) after successful testing, enabling faster and more reliable releases.
   
3. Extensibility: Jenkins offers a vast ecosystem of plugins, allowing users to extend its functionalities to integrate with various tools, version control systems, build systems, and cloud services
   
4. Easy Configuration: Jenkins provides a web-based user interface that allows users to configure and manage jobs, pipelines, and automation workflows using simple configurations or by writing scripts
   
5. Scalability and Distribution: supports distributed builds, allowing multiple agents (nodes) to execute tasks concurretly, thus scaling resources to handle larger work loads.
   
6. Monitoring and Notifications

### How jenkins work?

- Developers create jobs or pipelines in Jenkins, defining the sequence of tasks, such as fetching code from a version control system, building applications, running tests and deploying to various environments

- Jenkins monitors source code repositories for changes and triggers jobs or pipelines automatically upon detecting new commits

- It executes the defined tasks, compiles code, runs automated tests, and generates reports

- Jenkins provides logs and reports for each build, allowing developers to analyze and troubleshoot issues

### Use Cases

- Automated Build and Testing

- Continuous Deployment

- Infrastructure Automation
