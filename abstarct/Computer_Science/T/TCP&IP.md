# TCP & IP Protocol

### about

- TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used for networking. 
- This provides the foundation for communication across the internet and local networks.

### TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable and ordered delivery of data packets between devices on a network.
- This estalblishes a connection between two hosts before data transmission and ensures that data arrives intact and in the correct order.
- TCP handles tasks such as segmentation, reassembly, acknowledgment, and flow control to ensure reliable communication.
- This commonly used for applications that require guaranteed delivery of data, such as web browsing, email, file transfer (FTP), and remote login (SSH)


### IP: Internet Protocol

- IP is a network-layer protocol responsible for addressing and routing packets of data across networks.
- It provides the addressing scheme used to identify devices (hosts) on a network and the routing mechanism for delivering packets from source to destination.
- IP addresses are unique identifiers assigned to each device connected to a network, enabling data to be directed to the correct destination.
- IPv4 and IPv6 are the two main versions of the IP protocol in use today.
