# Binary data

### about

Binary data is represts data combinations of 0, 1.
The binary format used with ASCII or Unicode like.

GPT ans:
Binary data refers to any data or information that is represented using the binary number system, which consists of only two digits: 0 and 1. In computing, all data is eventually stored and processed in binary form at the lowest level.

Here are a few key points about binary data:

Binary System: Computers use the binary system because it's well-suited for digital devices. It represents data using combinations of 0s and 1s, also known as bits.

Representation: In binary, each digit represents a power of 2. For instance, from right to left, the digits represent 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, and so on.

Storage: Computers store data in binary form at the hardware level. This includes files, images, videos, text, and program instructions. Text characters, for example, are stored in binary format using a specific encoding scheme like ASCII or Unicode.

File Types: Binary files are files that contain data in a format understood only by the computer. This includes executable programs, multimedia files, and proprietary file formats that are not human-readable without specialized software.

Manipulation: While computers handle data in binary, humans typically interact with data in higher-level representations, such as text or images. Programmers work with binary data when they need to perform operations at a low level or manipulate data directly in its binary form.

Binary Operations: Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) and bitwise operations (bit shifts, XOR, etc.) are performed directly on binary data at the bit level.

Networking: Data transmitted over networks is often represented in binary format, with protocols specifying how information is structured and transmitted.

Understanding binary data is fundamental in computer science and programming, especially when dealing with low-level operations, memory management, file handling, and networking.

### type

1. Executable files     : These are binary files that can be executed by the operating system to perform tasks.
2. Library files        : Shared libraries contain code that can be used by multiple programs. They help in modulrizing and reusing code.
3. Data files           : These contain data in binary format and are used by app to store and retrieve data efficiently. Examples including image files, database files, and proprietary data formats.

### execute

1. Compilation      : Source code written in a programming language(C, C++) is compiled into a binary executable by a compiler.
2. Interpreter      : For scripting languages(Python, Perl), the scripts are interpreted at runtime, translating the code into machine instructions.
3. Dynamic linking  : When an executable uses shared libraries, the dynamic linker (Id.so) loads the necessary shared libraries into memory at runtime and resolves references to function and variables.

### binary files download

\# Package managers (e.g., apt, yum, dnf)

1. Respository query    : The package manager queries configured repositories to find the package.
2. Dependency resolution: This resolves any dependencies required by the package.
3. Download             : The package and its dependencies are downloaded.
4. Verification         : Integrity and authenticity of the packages are verified using checksums and signatures.
5. Installation         : The downloaded packages are unpacked and installed to the appropriate directories.
6. Configuration        : Post-install scripts may run to configure the package.

\# Executable scripts (e.g., curl)

1. Download script      : Using 'curl' or 'wget'
2. Execution

\# Binary packages (e.g., .deb, .rpm)[Debian-based or Red Hat-based]

1. Download package     : The binary package is downloaded.
2. Installation cmd     : The package manager is used to install the package.
3. Dependency Handling  : Additionaly commands might be needed to resolve dependencies.
4. Configuration        : Post-installation scripts within the package configure the software.
