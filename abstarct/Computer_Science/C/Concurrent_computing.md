# Concurrent computing

### about

- form of computing in which several computations are executed concurrently during overlapping time periods, instead of sequentially.
- Concurrent system is one where a computation can advance without waiting for all other computations to complete.
- Concurrent computing is a form of modular programming.
- distinct concept is equal with parallel computing.
- parallel computing is impossible on a single processor, as only one computation can occur at any instant.
- By contrast, concurrent computing consists of process lifetimes overlapping.
