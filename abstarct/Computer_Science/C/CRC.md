# CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check

### about

- The CRC is a error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.

### principle

- This generates a fixed-size checksum for a block of data.
- This checksum is based on the remainder of a polynomial division of the data's contents.

### remarks

- Not cryptographically secure.
