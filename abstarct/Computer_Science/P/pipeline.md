# pipeline

### what is pipeline

- Concept: in general sense, pipeline refers to a system or series of connected elements through which something flows. In technology and various industries, the term is commonly used to describe a process
  where tasks are divided into stages, and each stage performs a specific operation on the input, passing the transformed output to the next stage.

1. Data Processing Pipeline: Series of steps or stages where data flows through various operations, from ingestion to analysis or storage.

2. Software Development Pipeline: Series of automated steps involved in the development, testing, and deployment of software. it include tasks like code compilation, testing, code analysis, and deployment.

3. Pipeline in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): In devops practices, a pipeline refers to the automated process of delivering code changes from version control to production. It involves
   stages like building, testing, and deploying software in a controlled and automated manner.
4. Hardware Pipeline: In computer architecture, it's a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution to improve throughput. Each stage of the pipeline handles a different instruction.

5. Data Pipeline in Machine Learning: It,s a sequence of data processing components used to prepare data, tran models, evaluate performance, and deploy machine learning models.

### conclusion

- pipeline is a sequence of processing steps or tasks arranged in a linear process.
