# peer

### about

- In networking, a 'peer' typically refers to any device or entity participating in a communication session or protocol.
- The term 'peer' emphasizes equality and symmetry between the participants, meaning that each party onvolved has a similar role or capability in the communication process.


### Usage

- Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Networks
  - In here each device (or peer) acts as both a client and a server, capable of initiating connections with other peers and responding to requests from them.
  - Decentralized communication platforms like Skype.

- TCP/IP Communication
  - In TCP/IP communication, each end of a connection is typically referred to as a 'peer'
  - For example, in a client-server architecture, the client and server are peers connected via a TCP/IP connection.
  - Each peersends and receives data packets to and from the other peer.
  
- Encryption and Security
  - In security protocols like Transport layer Security(TLS), peers exchange cryptographic information to establish a secure connection.
  - During the TLS handshake, both client and server negotiate encryption parameters and exchange cryptographic keys.
  - In this context, both the client and server are considered peers in the secure communication process.
