### A
### B
- box-drawing character: used to indicates structure. ex)┌─, ├─, ┬─ ...
### C
### D
### E
- Entity: In the context of networking and programming, an 'entity' generally refers to a distinct and identifiable component or object that participates in a system or communication process.
### F
- flag: variable or a value that acts as a signal for a certain condition or behavior. Flag control the program with presence or absence of a features.
- failover: A method of protecting computer systems from failure, in which standby equipment automatically takes over when the main system fails.
### G
### H
### I
- Intermediate value: generated during computation process. Temporary features.
- i686: indicates about using 32-bit set architecture (ISA)
### J
### K
### L
- Linting: process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors.
- Lexical environment: describes the association between identifiers (like variables and functions) and their values within the structure of the code. Consited with two main components<br>
1. Environment Record<br>

- Portability: The ability of software to be transferred from one machine or system to another.
### Q
### R
- Race Condition: A situation where the behavior of a program depends on the sequence or timing of events. Specifically, it occurs when the outcome of a program is affected by the order in which different parts of the code
                are executed concurrently.
