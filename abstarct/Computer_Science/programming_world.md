### List

### A
### B
- box-drawing character: used to indicates structure. ex)┌─, ├─, ┬─ ...
- bitstream: This is a sequence of bits (binary digits, 0s and 1s) that is transmitted or processed as a continuous flow.
### C
### D
- Delimiter: A blank space, comma, or other characters that indicates the beginning or end of a character string.
### E
- Entity: In the context of networking and programming, an 'entity' generally refers to a distinct and identifiable component or object that participates in a system or communication process.
### F
- flag: variable or a value that acts as a signal for a certain condition or behavior. Flag control the program with presence or absence of a features.
- feature flag: A technique that allows developers to enable or disable specific functionality in a software app without new code from switch code(developer with customer).
- failover: A method of protecting computer systems from failure, in which standby equipment automatically takes over when the main system fails.
- flash: This refers to the process of installing or writing firmware.
- fetch: This refers to retrieving data from a server or database.
### G
### H
- Headless browser: Handle browser without GUI screen.(generally executed with backend process)
### I
- Intermediate value: generated during computation process. Temporary features.
- i686: indicates about using 32-bit set architecture (ISA)
- image file: This refers to snapshot or complete set of data to be loaded
### J
### K
### L
- Linting: process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors.
- Lexical environment: describes the association between identifiers (like variables and functions) and their values within the structure of the code. Consited with two main components<br>
1. Environment Record<br>
2. Reference to the Outer Environment
### M
### N
### O
- Origin: Web content's origin is defined by the scheme (protocol), hostname (domain), and port of the url used to access it. ex) http://localhost:3000
- Overhead: This require extra resources or time to perform a task beyond the minimum necessary.
### P
- Portability: The ability of software to be transferred from one machine or system to another.
- Primitive: simple functions
### Q
### R
- Race Condition: A situation where the behavior of a program depends on the sequence or timing of events. Specifically, it occurs when the outcome of a program is affected by the order in which different parts of the code are executed concurrently.
- Redundancy: bakup or extra, on purpose, for safety.
- release: 베포
### S
- Serial port: This is a physical communication interface that enables the transfer of data between devices, such as a computer and a modem or a printer, this transmit data serially(bits of data are sent )
- self contained: A datagram or packet carries all the essential information within itself to be processed and routed independently, with out relying on external factors.
- System-wide: refers to something that affects or involves an entire system rather than just a specific part or component of that system.
- Sigint: Signl interrupt event that indicate about interrupting or stop its execution. ex) ctrl + c
### T
- Transpiling: Modify code to code, like c to js. The output is humanreadable.
### U
### V
### W
### X
### Y
### Z
