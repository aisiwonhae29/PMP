# Wasm: WebAssembly

### about

- Wasm is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
- It is designed as a portable, low-level compilation target to enable building high-performance applications that can run on the web, mobile devices, and other environments.

### feature

1. Portable and Efficient: Wasm is designed to be portable across different platforms and operating systems, while providing performance close to that of native machine code.

2. Web-Freindly: Wasm is designed to complement and run alongside JS in web brouwser, allowing developers to take advantage of its performance benefits for computationally intensive tasks.

3. Language-Agnistic: Wasm is a low-level bytecode format that can be targeted by compilers for various programming languages.

4. secure Sandbox: Wasm code runs in a secure sandbox environment, isolated from the rest of the system, providing strong security guarantees.

5. Module System: Wasm has a module system that allows for efficient loading, linking, and sharing of code between modules, enabling code reuse and modular development.

6. Tooling and Ecosystem: Wasm has a growing ecosystem of tools, compilers, and libraries that facilitate its development and integration into various environment.


### Usage

1. Cloud and Edge Computing

- Wasm can be used for serverless computing, edge computing, and other cloud-based applications, providing a secure and efficient execution environment.

2. IoT and Embedded systems

- Wasm's small foot print and portability make it suitable for runinng on resource-constrained devices and embedded systmes.

3. Game Development

- Wasm is executed as compilation target to achieve better performance and portability across different platforms.
