# premaster key

### about

- This used for establishing a secure communication channel to SSL/TLS protocol.
- In SSL/TLS encryption, both the client and the server need to establish a shared key to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged during the session.

### sequence

- The pre-master key is essentially a random secret value generated by the client during the SSL/TLS handshake process.
- Encrypt with server's public key and sent to the server.
- Once the server receives the encrypted pre-master key, it decrypts it using its private key, thus obtaining the pre-master key.
- Both the client and the server then use this pre-master key, along with other negotiated parameters, to compute a master secret key.

### key

- The use of pre-master keys ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the encrypted pre-master key during the handshake, they can't derive the session keys without knowledge of the server's private key.
- Thus maintaining the security of the communication channel.
