Object-oriented programming
In object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a computer program. Formally, "instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value (realization), and these may be called an instance object; "instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of an instance is called instantiation.

An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance of its class. That is, it is a member of a given class that has specified values rather than variables. In a non-programming context, you could think of "dog" as a type and your particular dog as an instance of that class.[1]

In class-based programming, objects are created as instances of classes by subroutines called constructors, and destroyed by destructors. An object is an instance of a class as it can access to all data types(primitive as well as non primitive), and methods etc, of a class. Therefore, objects may be called a class instances or class objects. Object instantiation is known as construction. Not all classes can be instantiated â€“ abstract classes cannot be instantiated, while classes that can be instantiated are called concrete classes. In prototype-based programming, instantiation is instead done by copying (cloning) a prototype instance.[2]
