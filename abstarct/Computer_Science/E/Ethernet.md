# Ethernet

### about

- Ethernet is a widely used networking technology for connecting devices in a local area network(LAN). 
- This provides a way for devices such as computers, printers etc, to communicate with each other over a shared medium.


### features

1. Physical Medium
- Ethernet originally used coaxial cables as the physical medium for transmitting data.
- This has evolved to support various types of cabling, including twisted pair copper cables and fiber optic cables.
  
2. Topology
- Ethernet networks can be oorganized in various topologies, including star, bus, ring and hybrid topologyies.
- In a typical Ethernet LAN, devices are connected to a central networking device such as a switch or router.

3. Data Link Layer Protocol
- Ethernet operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- This provides a fram e-based communication protocol for sending and receiving data packets between devices on the same network segment.

4. MAC Addresses
- Each device on an Ethernet network is assigned a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address, which is a hardware address burned into the network interface card (NIC)
- MAC addresses are used to identify devices on the network and facilitate communication.

5. Ethernet Frames
-  Data is transmitted over Ethernet networks in frames, which consist of a header and payload.
- The header contains information such as source and destination AMC addresses, while the paylaod carries the actual data being transmitted.

6. Ethernet Standards

7. Ethernet Switches
- Ethernet swiches are networking devices that forward data packets between devices on an Ethernet network.
- Unlike hubs(which simply repeat incoming packets to all connected devices), siwthches use MAC addresses to intelligently route packets only to the intended recipient, increasing network efficiency.

### conclusion

- Ethernet has become the de facto standard for wired LANs due to its reliability, scalability, and widespread adoption.
- It forms the backbone of many corrporate and home networks, providing connectivity for a wide range of devices and applicaitions.
