# ECONNRESET 

### about

- the ECONNRESET indicates that a connection was forcibly closed by the peer(remote party).
- In networking, when two parties communicate over a TCP connection, they exchange data packets, If one party abruptly closes the connection without properly completing the data exchange or without sending a proper TCP termination handshake, the other party receives an 'ECONNRESET' error.

2. Server Crashed or Restarted

3. Client closed connection abruptly
- The client terminated its conneciton with the server without following the proper TCP termination procedure.

4. Firewall or Proxy Issues
- Network intermediaries such as firewalls or proxies may forcibly close connections under certain conditions, leading to an 'ECONNRESET' error
