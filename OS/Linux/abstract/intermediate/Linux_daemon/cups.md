# cups: Common Unix Printing System

### about 

- 'cups' is a widely used open-source printing system that provides a standard way to manage printers and print jobs on Unix-like operating systems.
- The print job and printer job is related with physical printer associated work.

### logic

- When a user or app initiates a print operation, the data to be printed is converted into a print job and sent to the 'cups' server.
- The 'cups' server then manages and processes the print job, formatting it appropriately for the target printer.
