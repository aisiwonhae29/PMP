Basic Concept of a Relative Clause
A relative clause is a type of dependent clause that modifies a noun or pronoun in the main clause. It provides additional information about the noun or pronoun, making the meaning clearer or more specific. Relative clauses often begin with relative pronouns like "who," "whom," "whose," "which," or "that."

Key Components of Relative Clauses
Relative Pronouns: These introduce the relative clause and relate to a noun or pronoun in the main clause.

Who: Refers to people (subject).
Whom: Refers to people (object).
Whose: Indicates possession.
Which: Refers to animals and things.
That: Refers to people, animals, and things (can be used as a subject or object).
Antecedent: The noun or pronoun that the relative clause modifies.

Example: "The book that I read was fascinating."
Here, "book" is the antecedent, and "that I read" is the relative clause.
Types of Relative Clauses
Restrictive (Defining) Relative Clauses:

Essential to the meaning of the sentence.
Do not use commas.
Example: "The student who studies hard will succeed."
The clause "who studies hard" is necessary to define which student.
Non-Restrictive (Non-Defining) Relative Clauses:

Provide extra information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.
Use commas to set off the clause.
Example: "My brother, who lives in New York, is coming to visit."
The clause "who lives in New York" adds extra information about "my brother."
Examples of Relative Clauses
Using "who":

"The teacher who inspires me is retiring."
"who inspires me" modifies "teacher."
Using "whom":

"The artist whom we met was very talented."
"whom we met" modifies "artist."
Using "whose":

"The student whose book was lost is looking for it."
"whose book was lost" modifies "student."
Using "which":

"The car, which is red, belongs to my neighbor."
"which is red" modifies "car."
Using "that":

"The movie that we watched was thrilling."
"that we watched" modifies "movie."
Functions of Relative Clauses
Subject of the Clause:

"The person who called me was my friend."
"who called me" acts as the subject of the clause.
Object of the Clause:

"The book that I borrowed was excellent."
"that I borrowed" acts as the object of the clause.
Possessive Form:

"The writer whose novel was published is famous."
"whose novel was published" indicates possession.
Summary
Relative clauses are dependent clauses that provide additional information about a noun or pronoun in the main clause. They begin with relative pronouns such as "who," "whom," "whose," "which," or "that." Relative clauses can be restrictive (defining) or non-restrictive (non-defining) and serve to specify or add extra details about the antecedent. Understanding the use of relative clauses enhances sentence clarity and provides richer descriptions in writing.
